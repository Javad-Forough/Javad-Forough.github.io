I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at Imperial College London and a member of the [Network and Systems Lab](https://netsys.doc.ic.ac.uk/index.html), under the supervision of [Prof. Hamed Haddadi](https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/h.haddadi). My work focuses on secure and private deployment of machine-learning (ML) models on edge devices. My research explores solutions to challenges in model privacy and auditability, aiming to ensure that proprietary ML models remain protected and operate in compliance with user agreements. This involves leveraging cutting-edge techniques in secure computing and trusted execution environments to address limitations such as high overheads and constrained capabilities of edge devices, while enabling robust and efficient ML deployment pipelines.



Previously, I was a **Doctoral (Ph.D.) Student** in Computer Science at [Umeå University](https://www.umu.se/en/), Sweden, funded by the Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program ([WASP](https://wasp-sweden.org/)). My Ph.D. research was supervised by [Prof. Erik Elmroth](https://people.cs.umu.se/elmroth/index.html) and [Dr. Monowar Bhuyan](https://people.cs.umu.se/monowar/index.html), and I was a member of the [Autonomous Distributed Systems Lab](https://www.umu.se/en/research/groups/autonomous-distributed-systems-lab/).
